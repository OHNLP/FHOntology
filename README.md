These data sets contain automatically aligned family history concepts derived from a clinical corpus to map disease category resources, including Clinical Classification System (CCS), Phecode, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Human phenotype ontology, and Human disease ontology (HDO). The direct mapping result is a collection of all vocabulary identifiers in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to be identical if these identifiers share the same Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The indirect mapping extends the parent or broader or alike relational CUIs associated with the FH concept on top of direct mapping results. These data sets are pipe delimitated '|'.
